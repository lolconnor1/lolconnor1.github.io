			<h2>Welcome to theConnorChannel!</h2>
			<p>This site will mostly be used as an opportunity to practice (and flex) the skills that I learn on my path to becoming a software developer! One day, this site will be filled with many interesting pages and you will be able to see my growth as a developer. Animations, magic, explosions, clickable buttons; the possibilities are endless!</p>
			<h2>I hope you enjoy your stay!</h2>

				<h2>The Man, The Myth, The Legend:</h2>
				<p>Wassup! My name is Connor A.K.A. C-Money.</p>
				<p>I'm a computer science student from Toronto who loves to create everything from music to websites.</p>
				<p>Some of my hobbies include skateboarding, basketball, and pretending to read books that I don't understand to look cool and interesting.</p>
				<p>If I could turn into an animal, I would probably want to be a bear because I love to sleep. And if I were being chased by the CIA, I think I could probably survive at least 3 days.</p>

				<h3>Skills:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>looking smug</p></li>
					<li><p>coding</p></li>
					<li><p>witty humor</p></li>
					<li><p>massive ego</p></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>That's about it! C-Money out!</h3>

			<h3>6/17/2024</h3>
			<p>I created this site that you are looking at using basic HTML and CSS. Although it is pretty empty for now, upgrades await in the near future!</p>
			<h3>6/19/2024</h3>
			<p>Today, I started learning some basic JavaScript and made a <a href = "counter.html">simple counter app</a>. I also learned how to make links as icons and added a link to my LinkedIn on the header.</p>
			<h3>6/22/2024</h3>
			<p>Yesterday, I created a simple <a href = "blackjack.html">Blackjack</a> game website(edit: using JavaScript). As of right now, the game works but I want to style it and add some features such as a deck counter, a win-loss tracker, C-Money, doubling down, and splitting.</p>
			<h3>6/23/2024</h3>
			<p>Today, I added some cool new features and fixed some of the bugs on my Blackjack page. Some stuff I added includes splitting, doubling down (though there is no C-Money yet), a deck counter (which I recycled from my previous counter page), a win-loss column so you can track your wins and losses. On the smaller side, I added a home icon which goes back to here, and did a little bit of styling. I think in the future I want to implement like an "educational mode" where you can see the probabilites and also learn the optimal Blackjack strategy but maybe I'll take a little break from this project first.</p>
			<h3>7/2/2024</h3>
			<p>I know, I've been pretty quiet recently. I got stuck with some school work while also trying to develop this awesome <a href = "minesweeper.html">Minesweeper</a> page in JavaScript. It is missing a few features (like winning) but I hope to get that sorted out soon. I also want to get back on some CSS and make these pages look sick. Anyways, C-MonDawg out.</p>
			<h3>7/6/2024</h3>
			<p>Minesweeper is now looking fucking awesome, no cap frfr. I still want to add the ability to customize the size of the board and number of bombs, but in the meantime I want to make my kick-ass website available on Google. Right now it says something about "pages cant be indexed" or some bullshit. I might have to go over to Google HQ and take matters into my own hands... But fr tho, search engine optimization begins!</p>
