        <h2>What is Pulsefex?</h2>
        <p>Pulsefex is an embedded systems project that captures and displays real-time heart rate and SpO2 levels. The
            system is built on the STM32WB55RG MCU and interfaces with the MAX30102 pulse oximeter and TMP102
            temperature sensor, with real-time data output to an SSD1306 OLED screen. This was my first embedded systems
            project and as such I was eager to contribute.</p>

    <div class="container fade-in-left" style="width:50%;">
        <h2>My Contributions:</h2>
        <p>My primary responsibility was the low-level interfacing of the SSD1306 screen with the STM32WB MCU via I2C,
            implemented entirely in C. I developed custom drivers to send bit data to the screen, allowing our team to
            quickly display and update heart rate visuals.
        </p>
        <p>I was also responsible for the circuit design and fabrication; I even learned how to solder parts together!

        <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
        <p>This project gave me hands-on experience with MCU architecture, low-level C programming, and real-time data
            retrieval. I gained confidence debugging hardware-level issues, integrating I2C communication protocols, puttign together electronic circuits, and
            overall enjoyed the 2 month development process as I stepped far outside of my comfort zone.</p>
